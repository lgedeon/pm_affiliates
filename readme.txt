Affiliate tracking doesn\'t have to be hard (or expensive). Let\'s keep it simple.

== Description ==
Add an affiliate number to share links. Add a cookie. Tag the sale/click. Done.

Does not calculate commissions or provide a fancy dashboard. Just tracks the info so that you can reward those who helped you get started.

Once sales are rolling in and you are making money hand over fist, you can switch to a more advanced (and expensive) plugin, or add the features you want in a complimentary plugin.

This will get you started for free with minimal effort.
